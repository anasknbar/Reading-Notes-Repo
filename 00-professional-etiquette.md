### Reflection: 

Upon reviewing the Professional Competencies, I gained insights into both my existing strengths and areas for growth. I found myself recognizing competencies that I need to work on further, while also realizing competencies that I already possess.
In summarizing these competencies, I've categorized them into two groups:

- bottom competencies
- top competencies.


## Bottom competencies

- The Growth Mindset Competency: Handling Ambiguity I often struggle with ambiguous tasks and assignments, particularly when there is limited data or information available to guide me. This uncertainty can impede my progress and hinder my ability to complete tasks efficiently.

- The Leadership Competency: Confidence Dealing with stress and competitiveness, especially in the workplace, has been challenging for me. It tends to elevate my stress levels and adversely affect my productivity. Developing confidence in such situations is crucial for overcoming these challenges.

- The Communication Competency: Speaking Speaking effectively has been a recurring challenge for me. I frequently find myself unable to articulate my ideas confidently, resulting in incomplete communication and missed opportunities to contribute effectively.


## Top competencies

- The Growth Mindset Competency: Constant Improvement I am committed to continuous growth and development, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge. Embracing a mindset of constant improvement allows me to adapt to changing circumstances and strive for excellence in all endeavors.


- The Growth Mindset Competency: Curiosity I possess a natural curiosity and inclination to explore new ideas and solutions. This curiosity drives me to ask questions, seek understanding, and pursue innovative approaches to problem-solving.


- The Leadership Competency: Ownership Taking ownership of my responsibilities and actions is a strength that I consistently demonstrate. I am proactive in accepting accountability for my work, persevering through challenges, and contributing to the success of my team and projects.

Conversely, I will continue to leverage and strengthen my top competencies by embracing learning opportunities, fostering my curiosity through ongoing exploration and experimentation, and embracing ownership of my professional growth and development.
