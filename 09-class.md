# Linear regression
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (often called the target or outcome) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features). The main goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) through the data points that can predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

  Data Preparation: You start with a set of data points, where each data point consists of values for the independent variable(s) and the corresponding value for the dependent variable.

  Model Fitting: Using a library like scikit-learn, statsmodels, or numpy, you fit a straight line to the data points. The goal is to find the line that minimizes the difference between the actual values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the line.

  Prediction: Once you have the fitted line, you can use it to predict the dependent variable's values for new values of the independent variable(s) that weren't in the original dataset.

  Evaluation: Finally, you evaluate the performance of the model, typically by examining metrics like the coefficient of determination (R-squared) or by visualizing the fitted line against the actual data points.

Linear regression is widely used for tasks like predicting house prices based on square footage or estimating sales based on advertising spending. It's a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning due to its simplicity and interpretability.
