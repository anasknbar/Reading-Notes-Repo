### sumary: 
Angela Lee Duckworth,the speaker, share her unusall observiation, when she left her job as a management consulting to teach a 7th graders math, when she notice that some of her strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.
Whereas some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. Concluding that **IQ was not** the only difference
between my best and my worst students.this observation leads Angela Lee Duckworth to the graduate school to become a psychologist and starts studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, focusing in every study on one question, who is successful and why? 

#### research results:
- doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily
- one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was **grit**.

**what is Grit ?** 
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. 

- **talent** doesn't make you gritty. data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. 

- the best for building grit in kids is something called **"growth mindset."** 
- **growth mindset** it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.
