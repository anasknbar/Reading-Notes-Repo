### Readings: Whitboarding + Big O

## Asymptotic Analysis:
is a method to describe how good the performance of algorithm is, and basically it conclude the :

- best case - Minimum time required for program execution (Big Omega).
- average case - Average time required for program execution (Big O).
- and worst case scenario - Maximum time required for program execution ().

for specific algorithm

## Why performance analysis is important?

knowing the performance of your algorithm (application)
is  crusial as it enables the developer to address any issues that make the app slower which in turn will produce more user-friendliness, modularity, security, maintainability applications.

## what are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Asymptotic analysis?

#### Advantages:

- give us insight on the performance based to input size.
- enables us to compare multiple algorithms and choose the best one  
- easy to implement

#### Disadvantages:
- inaccurate estimation of algorithm performance metrics.
- Ignores varied performance-influencing factors beyond input size.
- Similar complexity, varying actual efficiency results.
- Deciding optimal complexity involves intricate trade-off analysis.
