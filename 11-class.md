### Serverless Overview

**Definition:**
Serverless architecture is a deployment model where servers are abstracted away from developers. Code execution is event-driven, triggered by actions such as HTTP requests or file changes.

**Execution Without Servers:**
While servers do execute the code, they are managed by platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, keeping them hidden from developers.

### Serverless Compute Spectrum

**Deployment Spectrum:**
- **Full Control:** Building and managing your own servers and infrastructure.
- **Serverless:** Deploying code on platforms that manage all underlying infrastructure, removing concerns about hardware and operating systems.

**Intermediate Levels:**
- **Virtual Private Servers (VPS):** Abstract hardware concerns but manage OS and software.
- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** Further abstraction, handling more of the web server and OS concerns.

### Serverless Implementations

**Major Cloud Providers:**
- **AWS Lambda:** Leading serverless platform with strong Python support.
- **Azure Functions:** Limited and less mature Python support.
- **IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk:** Based on Apache OpenWhisk.
- **Google Cloud Functions:** Native support for Python 3.x.
- **Webtask.io:** Initially JavaScript, now includes Python runtime.

### Serverless Frameworks

**Popular Frameworks:**
- **Serverless Framework:** A generic tool for deploying serverless applications.
- **Zappa:** Simplifies AWS Lambda and API Gateway deployments.
- **Chalice:** Developed by AWS, specifically for Python applications.

### Serverless Environment Comparisons

**Python Support:**
- **AWS Lambda:** Mature support for Python 2 and 3.7.
- **Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions:** Beta support for Python, less stable for production use.

**Comparison Articles:**
- **Platform Comparisons:** Articles like "Microsoft Azure Functions vs. Google Cloud Functions vs. AWS Lambda" help decide which platform to use.

### Vendor Lock-In Concerns

**Portability Issues:**
- **Vendor Lock-In:** Concerns about being tied to a single platform, though some argue it's not a major issue currently.
- **Advice:** Focus on a single vendor to avoid unnecessary complexity.
