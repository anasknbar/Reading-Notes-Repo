## Cryptography:
 is the science and practice of securing communication and information through the use of codes so that only authorized parties can access and process it. It encompasses a range of techniques and methods designed to achieve several key objectives:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information remains private and accessible only to those who are authorized to view it.
   
2. **Integrity**: Guaranteeing that data cannot be altered or tampered with during storage or transmission without detection.
   
3. **Non-repudiation**: Preventing the sender of a message from denying their intentions in creating or sending the message.
   
4. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of parties involved in communication and ensuring the origin and destination of information.

### Techniques and Methods

Cryptography employs various cryptographic algorithms or ciphers to transform plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encoded data), and vice versa. These algorithms are classified into two main types:

- **Symmetric-key cryptography**: Uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. Examples include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

- **Public-key cryptography**: Uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Examples include RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

### Applications

Cryptography is crucial in numerous applications:

- **Data Privacy**: Protecting sensitive information such as financial transactions, personal data, and corporate communications.
  
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifying the authenticity of digital documents and messages.
  
- **Secure Communication**: Ensuring secure transmission over networks, including the internet, to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
